# Kaggle-BNP
This is the first my first kaggle I did myself. It is a classification problem. The raw dataset variables’ names (v1,v2…)make no sense. Therefore, we just focus on the variables we have.

Main jobs I did are feature generation and model ensembling.  Limited to my laptop
Capacity, cross validation with ensemble model (Random Forest) can not be run .
